### DocsGPT using Google Colaboratory ([GitHub](https://github.com/Farhad-Davaripour/DocsGPT))

- Collaborated in the development of DocsGpt, an AI-powered app that enables anyone with a Gmail account to easily upload PDF files and ask questions using GPT-3 embedding.
- Provided a user-friendly solution for PDF document analysis and question-answering, using Google Collaboratory, making it accessible to a wider audience without requiring installing or interacting with code

### Machine Learning Course - MECE 610 (June 2021 – March 2022)

_University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada_ ([GitHub](https://github.com/arminnorouzi/ML-developed_course))

- Designed and created 50+ examples covering the fundamentals of Machine Learning, as well as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), decision-tree, ensemble learning, and Deep Learning, with thorough theoretical explanations.
- Developed 3 in-depth tutorials on popular Machine Learning libraries such as Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch, featuring practical examples in areas such as Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Time Series Estimation.
- Covering transfer learning techniques for both computer vision and NLP models to enable learners to leverage pre-trained models for their own tasks.
