### Machine Learning Course - MECE 610	(June 2021 – March 2022)
_University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada_ ([GitHub](https://github.com/arminnorouzi/ML-developed_course))
* Designed 50+ examples of ML basics, ANN, CNN, SVM, and deep learning including theoretical detail
* Developed 3 tutorials on Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch with examples in computer vision, natural language processing, and time series estimation

### Deep Learning Optimal Control	(January 2022 – May 2022)

_Mechatronics in Mobile Propulsion (MMP), Aachen, Germany (Remote)_

* Developed a dynamics emission model using Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) with a prediction accuracy of 96%
* Established an imitation of the optimal controller using a deep neural network and replacing with online optimization to increase optimization speed by 50x faster

### Real-time Vehicle Emission Model (January 2021 – December 2021)
_IAV GmbH, Gifhorn, Germany (Remote)_

* Automated a systematic method using K-means clustering algorithm to select the most accurate ML model based on application of model to decrease development time up to 8 times
