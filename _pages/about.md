I am currently a Ph.D. Candidate at the University of Alberta in the mechanical engineering program. I am working on a future energy system (FES) project entitled "Control of CI Engines for Efficient and Robust Biomass Utilization." I am working to develop control strategies using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to decrease diesel engine emission in Real-Diving Cycle (RDE).

I received my B.S. (2014) in mechanical engineering from the University of Tabriz (Tabriz, Iran) and my M.S. (2017) in Mechanical Engineering (vehicle dynamics & control) from K.N. Toosi University of Technology (Tehran, Iran). I have started my Ph.D. program in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Alberta (UofA), Edmonton, Canada since May 2018. 

I am passionate about AI and have extensive experience in Matlab and python. I am eager to learn new technologies and adapt to new environments.
