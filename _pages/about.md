I am a Machine Learning Engineer at The Citco Group Limited, skilled in creating end-to-end data-driven solutions for deployment on edge or cloud platforms. My background includes experience as a Data Scientist at Skyjack Inc. and a Machine Learning Researcher at the Energy Mechatronics Lab at the University of Alberta, where I developed a strong understanding of the entire data pipeline.

I am proficient in Apache Spark and have experience working with Databricks, allowing me to efficiently perform complex data operations on large datasets. My passion for teaching led me to develop and teach a Machine Learning course at the University of Alberta, creating 50+ practical examples for students, and hold two workshops with 120+ attendees covering various topics in ML, computer vision, and transfer learning.

With experience working with AWS platforms, such as AWS SageMaker, S3, EC2, and Lambda, I am confident in my ability to help businesses achieve their goals through data-driven decisions. I am excited to continue applying my skills and knowledge to create innovative data solutions and help businesses thrive.
