I am currently a Ph.D. Candidate at the University of Alberta in the mechanical engineering program. I am working on a future energy system project to reduce internal combustion engines' emissions using Hydrogen and bio-fuel, employing AI and control theory. I am working to develop control strategies utilizing AI to decrease diesel engine emissions in the real-driving cycle.

I am passionate about AI and data science and have extensive experience in MATLAB and Python. I have successfully passed the IBM data science specialization, and the deep learning specialization offered by DEEPLEARNING.AI. I am also highly skilled in writing documentation using Latex and published articles in highly ranked conferences and journals with +150 citations. I am eager to learn and adapt to new environments.
