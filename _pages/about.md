As a Machine Learning Engineer and an accomplished Ph.D. in Engineering, my expertise lies in developing, implementing, and deploying Machine Learning solutions to optimize business processes and drive efficiency. Currently, I am part of the innovation technology team at Citco, where I've played a key role in delivering end-to-end ML solutions that significantly improved system automation.

I am well-versed in programming languages like Python, SQL, JavaScript, and R and have hands-on experience with tools and frameworks like Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, AWS, PyTorch, Databricks, Apache Spark, and Docker. I've used these skills to develop an ML infrastructure on AWS to predict various business outcomes for Citco and build robust ETL pipelines for batch data and streaming data using Apache Spark and Databricks for improved business outcomes.

As a freelance AI and Computer Science Content Creator, I've developed a comprehensive course on machine learning and written articles on Medium for various publications about essential algorithms and ML system design, helping other professionals understand and leverage these complex concepts.

In my past role as a Data Scientist at Skyjack Inc, I led the successful delivery of several projects by designing and deploying ML pipelines, which drastically improved engineering and product team efficiency. During my time as an Applied Machine Learning Researcher at the University of Alberta, I led research teams and delivered real-time ML solutions to industrial partners. My research was recognized not only by our industrial partners but also published in academic peer-reviewed publications and cited by the academic community with over 20 publications, 450 citations, and an h-index of 12.

My mission is to continue leveraging my skills and knowledge to build innovative solutions that contribute to improving operational efficiencies and delivering business value.
