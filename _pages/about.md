As a Machine Learning Engineer at The Citco Group Limited, I specialize in creating end-to-end data-driven solutions that can be deployed on edge or cloud platforms. Prior to joining The Citco Group Limited, I gained experience as a Data Scientist at Skyjack Inc. and a Machine Learning Researcher at the Energy Mechatronics Lab at the University of Alberta. I have a solid understanding of the entire data pipeline, from data collection to deployment, and can design and implement data solutions that meet the specific needs of a business.

I have a strong background in data engineering and big data processing, with proficiency in Apache Spark and experience working with Databricks, a platform for data engineering and data science built on top of Spark. I am experienced in data processing, transformation, and cleaning, and can work with large datasets and perform complex data operations efficiently.

In addition to my technical skills, I am passionate about teaching and content creation in the field of data and machine learning. I developed and taught a Machine Learning course at the University of Alberta, where I created 50+ practical examples for students. I also held two workshops with 120+ attendees, covering various topics in ML, computer vision, and transfer learning. I believe in the power of education and enjoy sharing my knowledge with others.

With my experience in data engineering and machine learning, I am confident in my ability to help businesses make data-driven decisions and achieve their goals. I have experience working with different AWS platforms, such as AWS SageMaker, S3, EC2, and Lambda, to develop and deploy ML models. I am excited to continue applying my skills and knowledge to create innovative data solutions and help businesses thrive.
